\paragraph*{Abstract}
In these lecture notes, we give a brief introduction to some elements of category theory.
The choice of topics is guided by applications to functional programming.
Firstly, we study initial algebras, which provide a mathematical characterization of datatypes and recursive functions on them.
Secondly, we study monads, which give a mathematical framework for effects in functional languages.
The notes include many problems and solutions.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{About Category Theory}
\emph{Category theory} is a mathematical area of endeavour and language developed to reconcile and unify mathematical phenomena from different disciplines.
It was developed from the 1940s on, in particular by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane.
Category theory studies objects by studying the way they interact with other objects of the same kind.
Its power arises from \emph{abstraction}:
by boiling down constructions to their essence, analogous situations can be formally identified using category theory.

The objects we can study using category theory are diverse;
while the origins of category theory lie in pure mathematics, it has now found applications throughout mathematics, computer science, and other areas of endeavor.
In these notes we introduce some basic concepts from category theory.
The choice of topics is guided by applications in the area of \emph{(functional) programming}; firstly, the structuring of effectful programs using \emph{monads} (see \cref{sec:monads}), and, secondly, the mathematical justification and derivation of \emph{recursion principles} such as \verb!fold! for the datatype of lists (see \cref{sec:initial-algs}).
We also study infinite datatypes (see \cref{sec:coinductive}).


\section{Learning Material on Category Theory}
\label{sec:material}


There are many topics of category theory not discussed in these notes.
Below, we list some resources that are freely available;
a very extensive list of resources is given at \url{https://www.logicmatters.net/categories/}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Pierce's book \cite{pierce} (available for free) gives a brief introduction to category theory with some applications to computing.

\item Leinster's book \cite{leinster} (available for free online, under a free license) gives a concise introduction to category theory.
It is a good resource for the basic concepts, but does not feature many examples from computer science.

\item The rather substantial textbook by Barr and Wells \cite{barr-wells} (available for free online) covers a lot more than we are going to discuss in these notes.

\item The Catsters \cite{catsters} provide a lecture series on category theory on YouTube.
  
\item A list of resources on category theory is maintained at \url{https://www.logicmatters.net/categories/}.
\end{itemize}

Throughout these notes, pointers to further sources, such as textbooks and research articles, are given.

\chapter{Brief Summary of Logical Foundations}
\label{sec:notation}

In these notes, we use set theory, \emph{informally}, as the language in which we define the concepts of category theory.
%Specifically, we talk about \emph{sets}, or \emph{collections}, of things.
%Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, we also talk about \emph{functions} from $X$ to $Y$.

\section{About set theory}

\begin{description}
\item [Sets/Collections] If $X$ is a set and $x$ is an element of $X$, we write $x \in X$.
  To define a set, we usually specify its elements, in an informal way.
  For instance, we consider the set $\NN$ of all natural numbers, with, e.g., $5 \in \NN$ and $37 \in \NN$.
  The set $\QQ$ is the set of all rational numbers, with, e.g., $2/3 \in \QQ$.

  We also consider a ``set of all sets''. Its elements are all sets.
  Here, we should be careful, as the set of all sets cannot be an element of itself; see the Barber paradox.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox}}
  To fix this issue, we consider \emph{collections} in addition to \emph{sets};
  the ``set'' of all sets is not a set, but a collection instead.

  Of course, the collection of all collections gives rise to the same problem;
  so, when considering foundations of mathematics very formally, one usually has an infinite hierarchy of sets or collections (or types, e.g., in Martin-Löf type theory).
  
\item [Functions] If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, we can consider the set of functions from $X$ to $Y$. This set is denoted $X \to Y$. We write $f \in X \to Y$, but also $f : X \to Y$, to say that $f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$.
  If $x \in X$, then $f(x) \in Y$ denotes the image of $x$ under $f$.
  When defining a function, we use the notation $x \mapsto f(x)$ to describe the image of $x$ under $f$. For instance, we define the function
  \begin{align*}
    \_/3 : \NN &\to \QQ
    \\
    n & \mapsto n/3
  \end{align*}
  This function takes as input a natural number, say, $n \in \NN$, and gives as output the rational number $n/3 \in \QQ$.
  
\item [Cartesian Product] Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, we can form a new set $X\times Y$, the \emph{(cartesian) product} of $X$ and $Y$. Its elements are pairs, written $(x,y)$, of an element $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.
  For instance, we can write addition of natural numbers as a function
  \begin{align*}
    (+) : \NN\times \NN &\to \NN
    \\
    (m,n) & \mapsto m + n
  \end{align*}
\item[(Disjoint) Union] Given two sets $X$ and $Y$, we can form a new set $X + Y$, the disjoint union of $X$ and $Y$. Its elements are those of $X$ and those of $Y$, with information about whether an element ``comes from'' $X$ or $Y$. (To be more concrete, one could say that elements of $X+Y$ are of the form $(0,x)$ for $x\in X$ or $(1,y)$ for $y\in Y$.)
\end{description}

\section{About logic}

We also use logical connectives in the definition of categorical concepts.

\begin{description}
\item[Definitions] When we write $x := y$, we define a new mathematical object $x$ to be given by $y$.
  For instance, we could define a function doubling its input as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \mathsf{double} &: \NN \to \NN
    \\
    \mathsf{double} &:=  x \mapsto x + x
  \end{align*}
  
\item[Equality] Given a set $X$ and $a,b\in X$, we can ask whether $a$ is equal to $b$; we write $a = b$ to assert that $a$ is equal to $b$.
  To \emph{prove} that two elements $a$ and $b$ of a set are equal, we have to understand what $a$ and $b$ are. For numbers $a$ and $b$, we intuitively know when they are equal.
  When proving that two functions $f, g : X \to Y$ are equal, we use the \emph{axiom of function extensionality}: to show that $f = g$, it suffices to show that for any possible input $x \in X$, the functions $f$ and $g$ agree on that input, that is, $f(x) = g(x)$.
  When showing that two monoid morphisms are equal, it suffices to show that their underlying functions are equal.
  When showing that two matrices are equal, it suffices to show that they are equal in each component.
\item [Implication]
  Given propositions $A$ and $B$, we write $A \implies B$ to say that $A$ implies $B$.
  
  More generally, if $X$ is a set and $P$ and $Q$ are predicates on $X$, we write $P\implies Q$ to express that if $P(x)$ holds for an element $x\in X$, then also $Q(x)$  holds for the element $x$.
  As an example, consider the predicates on natural numbers $n \in \NN$, ``$n$ is divisible by $4$'' and ``$n$ is even''.
  Then ``divisible by $4$'' $\implies$ ``is even''.

  Moreover, we write $P \iff Q$ if $P\implies Q$ and $Q\implies P$.
\item If $X$ is a set and $P$ is a predicate on $X$, we write:
\begin{description}
\item[forall] $\forall x\in X, P(x)$ to express that for every element in $X$, the property $P$ holds.
\item[exists] $\exists x\in X, P(x)$ to express that there exists at least one element in $X$ for which the property holds.
  For instance, consider the predicate
  \[  \mathsf{even}(n) := \exists k \in \NN, n = 2\times k.\]
\item[exists uniquely] $\exists! x\in X, P(x)$ to express that there exists a unique element in $X$ for which the property holds.
\end{description}
\end{description}

As an example, we can write the axiom of function extensionality as
\[ \big(\forall x \in X, f(x) = g(x)\big) \implies f = g \]


\section{About mathematical writing}

Mathematical text is typically structured into numbered ``environments'', for instance, ``definitions'', ``lemmas'', ``theorems'', and ``proofs''.
We briefly discuss each of these environments.

\begin{description}
\item[Definition] A definition introduces a new mathematical concept. You can think of a definition as an abbreviation, e.g., for a large structure consisting of many components.
  For instance, in \cref{dfn:category}, we define a category to be a structure consisting of objects, morphisms, etc.
  From then on, we use ``category'' as a shorthand for such a ``bundle'' of data satisfying the properties of a category.

  In the beginning, \textbf{it is important to learn definitions by heart.} Later, when you have understood the concepts well, you will be able to reproduce their definitions without explicitly learning them by heart.
\item[Example] An example is, usually, an instance of a definition. In \cref{example:set} (and \cref{lemma:set-category}), we look at specific data (sets and functions between them) and establish that they form a category.
\item[Lemma/Theorem/Proposition] All of these environments serve to formulate, precisely, a mathematical statement.
  The precise choice of environment signifies the status of the statement.
  A lemma is often of technical nature, a theorem is important, and a proposition is less important.
\item[Exercise] You are encouraged to think hard about every exercise in these notes. Some exercises are accompanied by solutions. It is worth first writing down your own solution, and then comparing it with the given solution.
\end{description}



\chapter{Categories}
\label{sec:categories}

\begin{reading*}
The definition of categories is also given in \cite[\S 2.1]{barr-wells}. Plenty of examples of categories are given in \cite[\S\S 2.3--2.5]{barr-wells}.

  The definition of categories is also given in \cite[\S 1.1]{leinster}, together with some examples.
  There, also isomorphisms are discussed, which we define in \cref{sec:isos}.

  The tutorial \cite{pierce} features the definition of categories in \cite[\S 2.1]{pierce}.
  It also introduces the notion of ``diagram'', which we do not use in the present notes.
\end{reading*}


\section{Definition}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:category}
  A \textbf{category} $\CC$ consists of the following data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A collection of objects, denoted by $\Ob{\CC}$;
\item For any given objects $X,Y \in \Ob{\CC}$, a collection of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$, denoted by $\Hom[\CC]{X}{Y}$ (or $\Hom{X}{Y}$ when the category $\CC$ is clear, or $\CHom \CC X Y$ or $X \to Y$);
\item For each object $X\in \Ob{\CC}$, a morphism $\Id[X] \in \Hom[C]{X}{X}$, called the \emph{identity morphism} on $X$;
\item A binary operation
\[
(\co{}{})_{X,Y,Z} : \Hom{Y}{Z} \to \Hom X Y \to \Hom X Z,
\]
called the \emph{composition}, and written infix without the indices $X,Y,Z$ as in $\co{f}{g}$.
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, this data should satisfy the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (\textbf{Left unit law}) For any morphism $f \in \Hom X Y$, we have 
\[
 \co{\Id[X]} {f} = f.
\]
\item (\textbf{Right unit law}) For any morphism $f \in \Hom X Y$, we have 
\[
  \co f {\Id[Y]} = f.
\]
\item (\textbf{Associative law}) For any morphisms $f\in \Hom X Y$, $g\in \Hom Y Z$ and $h\in \Hom Z W$, we have
\[
     \co {(\co f g)}{h} =  \co f {(\co g  h)}.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{dfn}

% \begin{intu} So what does a category represent? There are (at least) $3$ possible ways how one can think about this definition:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item A category represents a type system in the sense that the objects are the types and each hom-set is the type\footnote{In this case, each hom-set is a type, so isn't each hom-set an object again? Categories which satisfy such a property are called \textit{cartesian closed}.} of functions. See \cref{example:hask}.
% \item A category represents a \textit{bag} of instances of a particular mathematical structure (e.g. sets with a notion of addition). The objects are then instances of such a mathematical theory (e.g. $(\mathbb{N},+)$) and the morphisms are structure preserving functions (e.g. functions $f$ which satisfy $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$). See \cref{example:set,example:poset,monoidcategory}.
% \item A category represents a directed graph in the sense that an object is a vertex and a morphism is an edge.
% \item Anything (almost at least) can be seen as a category in some exotic way. 
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{intu}

\begin{nota} Let $\CC$ be a category.
\begin{itemize}
\item We write $X\in\CC$ instead of $X\in \Ob{\CC}$. 
\item Let $X,Y\in \CC$ be objects. A morphism $f\in\CHom{\CC}{X}{Y}$ can be visualized as \[ X \xrightarrow{f} Y. \]
\item Let $X,Y, Z \in \Ob{\CC}$ objects in $\CC$ and consider the following morphisms:
\[
f\in\CHom{C}{X}{Y}, \quad g\in\CHom{C}{Y}{Z}, \quad h\in\CHom{C}{X}{Z}.
\]
These morphisms can be visualized as a triangle:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[dr,swap, "h"] & Y \arrow[d, "g"] \\
& Z
\end{tikzcd}
\]
We say that such a triangle \textbf{commutes} if $h = \co{f}{g}$.
\item Let $X,Y_1,Y_2, Z \in \Ob{\CC}$ objects in $\CC$ and consider the following morphisms:
\[
f_1\in\CHom{C}{X}{Y_1}, \quad f_2\in\CHom{C}{X}{Y_2}, \quad g_1\in\CHom{C}{Y_1}{Z}, \quad g_2\in\CHom{C}{Y_2}{Z}.
\]
These morphisms can be visualized as a square:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[r, "f_2"] \arrow[d,swap, "f_1"] & Y_2 \arrow[d, "g_2"] \\
Y_1 \arrow[r, swap, "g_1"] & Z 
\end{tikzcd}
\]
We say that such a square \textbf{commutes} if $\co{f_1}{g_1} = \co{f_2}{g_2}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{nota}

\section{Examples of categories}

\begin{exa}\label{example:set} The \textbf{category of sets}, denoted by $\SET$, is the category specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a set.
\item If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, then is $\CHom \SET X Y$ the set of all functions from $X$ to $Y$.
\item The identity morphism $\Id[X]$ (on $X\in\Ob{\SET}$) is the identity function on $X$, i.e.
\begin{align*}
  \Id[X] : X &\to X
  \\
  x &\mapsto x.
\end{align*}
\item The composition of functions is given by the usual composition of functions, i.e. for $f\in \CHom \SET X Y$ and $g\in \CHom \SET Y Z$, the composition of $f$ and $g$ is:
\begin{align*}
  g \circ f : X&\to Z
  \\
  x &\mapsto g(f(x)).
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{exa}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:set-category}
  The data of $\SET$ satisfies the properties of a category; hence $\SET$ is indeed a category.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We first show that the left unit law holds. Let $X,Y\in \mathbf{Set}$ be sets and $f\in \CHom \SET X Y$ a function. We have to show that $\Id[X] \Comp f = f$; hence it suffices to show that they are pointwise equal.
  To show this, we fix an arbitrary $x \in X$, and compute
\[
   (f\circ \Id[X])(x) = f\left(\Id[X](x)\right) = f(x),
\]
where the first (resp. second) equality holds by definition of the composition (resp. identity morphism).\\
That the right unit law holds is analogous. To show that the associator law holds, let $X,Y,Z,W\in\mathbf{Set}$ and $f\in \CHom \SET X Y, g\in \CHom \SET Y Z$ and $h\in \CHom \SET Z W$. We have to show $h\circ (g\circ f) = (h\circ g)\circ f$; hence it suffices again to show that they are pointwise equal.
To show this, we fix an arbitrary $x \in X$, and compute
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \left(h\circ (g\circ f)\right)(x) &=& h\left((g\circ f)(x)\right)
  \\ 
                                    &=& h(g(f(x)))
  \\ 
                                    &=& (h\circ g)(f(x))
  \\ 
                                    &=& \left((h\circ g)\circ f\right)(x),
\end{eqnarray*}
where the first (resp. second, third, fourth) equality holds by definition of the composition of $h$ and $g\circ f$ (resp. composition of $g$ and $f$, composition of $h$ and $g$, composition of $h\circ g$ and $f$).
\end{proof}


We are now going to describe the category whose collection of objects is given by collection of Coq types:
\begin{exa}\label{exa:coq-cat}
  Consider the following data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a Coq type (of some fixed universe).
\item If $X$ and $Y$ are Coq types, then is $\CHom \COQ X Y$ the function type $X\to Y$.
\item The identity morphism $\Id[X]$ (on $X\in \Ob{\COQ}$) is the identity function on $X$, i.e.
\begin{lstlisting}
Definition idfun {X} : X -> X := fun x => x.
\end{lstlisting}
\item The composition of functions is given by the composition of functions:
\begin{lstlisting}
Definition compfun {X Y Z} (f : X -> Y) (g : Y -> Z) : X -> Z
:= fun x => g (f x).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
  Try it out, e.g., on \url{https://jscoq.github.io/scratchpad.html}:
\begin{lstlisting}
Eval compute in (compfun (fun x => x + 1) (fun x => x * 3) 5).
\end{lstlisting}

\end{exa}

\begin{exer}
  Prove (on paper) that the data defined in \cref{exa:coq-cat} defines a category.
  That is, show that it satisfies the axioms of a category.
  You might need to use the \textbf{axiom of functional extensionality}:
\begin{lstlisting}
Axiom functional_extensionality: forall {A B} (f g : A -> B),
  (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{exer}

\begin{exa}
  We repeat the definitions of \cref{exa:coq-cat} in Haskell instead of Coq.
  Does this data satisfies the axioms of a category?

  Due to Haskell allowing for the |undefined| value in each type, the situation is slightly more complicated; consider the following two functions:
\begin{lstlisting}
undef1 :: a -> a
undef1 = undefined

undef2 :: a -> a
undef2 = \x -> undefined
\end{lstlisting}
These are not equal by definition, but we have $\Id \Comp$ |undef1| $=$ |undef2|.
So by the right unit law, we must have that |undef1| = |undef2| (as morphisms in our sought category).
\end{exa}

% \begin{exer}
%   Compose the functions |undef1| and |undef2| with some other functions of your choice, and see what happens.
% \end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Read the Haskell wiki page on the category $\HASK$ \cite{haskell-wiki-hask}.
\end{exer}


However, when considering functions to be equal when they are \textbf{pointwise} equal, we can define a category of Haskell types:
\begin{dfn}\label{example:hask} The \textbf{category of Haskell types}, denoted by $\HASK$, is the category specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a Haskell type.
\item If $X$ and $Y$ are Haskell types, then is $\CHom \HASK X Y$ the collection of functions modulo the equivalence relation $\sim$ defined by identifying pointwise equal functions:
\[
f \sim g :\iff \forall x : X, f(x) = g(x).
\]
i.e. a morphism in $\HASK$ is an equivalence class of (Haskell) functions.
\item The identity morphism $\Id[X]$ (on $X\in\HASK$) is the equivalence class of the identity function on $X$.
\item The composition of (Haskell) functions is given by the equivalence class of the composition of functions, i.e., for $f\in \CHom \HASK X Y$ and $g\in \CHom \HASK Y Z$, the composition of $f$ and $g$ is the equivalence class of:
\[g\circ f : X\to Z: \lambda x. g(f(x)).\]
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}


\begin{exa}\label{example:posetcategories}
Recall that a \textit{preordered set} $(X,\leq)$ consists of a set $X$ together with a binary relation $(\leq)$ on $X$ which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reflexivity}: $\forall x\in X: x\leq x$.
\item \textbf{Transitivity}: $\forall x,y,z\in X: \left(x\leq y \wedge y\leq z\right) \implies x\leq z$.
\end{itemize}

  Let $(X,\leq)$ be a preordered set. We define the category $\PREtoCAT(X,\leq)$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The objects are the elements of $X$.
\item Let $x,y \in X$ be elements. The hom-set $\Hom x y$ consists of a unique element if $x\leq y$ and is empty otherwise.
\item  We define an identity morphism for each $x\in X$.
  By reflexivity (i.e., $x\leq x$), we have that $\Hom x x$ consists of a unique element, which we take to be the identity.
\item We define, for each $x,y,z\in X$, a composition operator
\[
\Hom y z \to \Hom x y \to \Hom x z.
\]
By definition of the hom-sets, we only have to define it in case $x\leq y$ and $y\leq z$.
But then, by transitivity (i.e. if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq z$, then $x\leq z$), we have that $\Hom x z$ consists of a unique element; that unique element is the composite.
\end{itemize}
%
We are now going to show that the axioms of a category holds.
To show the right unit law, we have to show that for each $x,y\in X$ and $f\in \Hom x y$, we have $\co{\Id[x]}{f} = f$.
This indeed holds since every hom-set has a unique element, but both $\co{\Id[x]}{f}$ and $f$ live in the same hom-set; hence they must be equal.
The proof that left unit law and associator law hold are analogous.
\end{exa}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:post_antisymmetry}]\label{exer:post_antisymmetry}
  A \textbf{partially ordered set} (poset) is a preordered set $(X,\leq)$ satisfying the following additional axiom:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Antisymmetry}: $\forall x,y\in X: (x\leq y \wedge y\leq x) \implies x=y$.
  \end{itemize}
  What does this axiom say about $\PREtoCAT(X,\leq)$?
\end{exer}

\begin{rem}
  To understand a definition in category theory, it is very helpful to think about what the definition means in a preordered set, viewed as a category. 
\end{rem}

\begin{exa}\label{example:poset} The category of posets, denoted by $\POS$, is the category specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a poset $(X,\leq)$.
\item A morphism from a poset $(X,\leq_X)$ to $(Y,\leq_Y)$ consists of a function $f:X\to Y$ such that the following property holds:
\[
\forall x_1, x_2 \in X: x_1\leq_X x_2 \implies f(x_1)\leq_Y f(x_2).
\]
\item The identity morphism on $(X,\leq_X)$ is the identity function on $X$.
\item The composition given by the composition of functions.
\end{itemize}

Before we can show that this data satisfies the axioms of a category, notice that the identity function is a morphism of posets and that the composition of poset morphisms is again a poset morphism, indeed: If $x_1\leq_X x_2$, then we also have $\Id[X](x_1) \leq_X \Id[X](x_2)$ because $\Id[X](x) = x$. If $f\in\CHom{\POS}{(X,\leq_X)}{(Y,\leq_Y)}$ and $g\in\CHom{\POS}{(Y,\leq_Y)} {(Z,\leq_Z)}$ are morphisms of posets, and $x_1,x_2\in X$, we have 
\[
  x_1\leq_X x_2 \implies f(x_1)\leq_Y f(x_2) \implies g(f(x_1))\leq_Z g(f(x_2)),
\]
where the first (resp. second) implication holds by $f$ (resp. $g$) being a morphism of posets. So our data is indeed well-defined.

The axioms of a category are satisfied by this data; the proof is exactly the same proof as showing that $\SET$ is a category because the identity and composition are defined in the same way.
\end{exa}

% \begin{exer}[\cref{sol:POS_isnt_a_posetcat}]\label{exer:POS_isnt_a_posetcat}
%   Is $\POS$ a preorder-category itself? That is, is there at most one morphism between any two objects?
% \end{exer}

% \begin{que}\label{que:posetcatstoallcats} In \cref{example:poset}, we have shown that $\POS$ is a category. However, by \cref{example:posetcategories}, we know that any poset also is a category. So we have that $\POS$ is a category whose objects are certain categories. Can we also have some category whose collection of objects is the collection of all categories, and if so, what are the morphisms of categories? 
% \begin{proof}[Solution]
% \cref{sec:functors} is devoted completely to this answer.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:uniqueid} Let $\CC$ be a category. For any object $X\in\CC$, $\Id[X]$ is the unique morphism which satisfies the following property: For any $Y\in\CC$ and $f\in\CHom \CC X Y$, we have 
\[
\co{\Id[X]} f = f.
\]
\begin{proof}
Assume $\tilde{\Id[X]}$ also satisfies this property, in particular we have $\co {\tilde{\Id[X]}} {\Id[X]} = \Id[X]$. However, by the right unit law, we also must have $\co{\tilde{\Id[X]}}{\Id[X]} = \tilde{\Id[X]}$. Hence, $\Id[X] = \tilde{\Id[X]}$.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{exa}\label{exa:monoidofrationalnumbers} In this example we are going to define a category which captures the multiplication of the rational numbers. Let $\CC$ be the category defined by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a unique object $\star$.
\item The (only) hom-set is given by
\[
\Hom{\star}{\star} = \mathbb{Q},
\]
i.e. each morphism corresponds with a rational number.
\item The composition is defined by the multiplication of rational numbers:
\[
\mathbb{Q} \to\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{Q} : (p,q)\mapsto p\cdot q.
\]
\item The identity morphism (of $\star$) is given by $1$.
\end{itemize}
That $\CC$ is indeed a category follows because for each $p\in\mathbb{Q}$, we have $p\cdot 1 = p = 1\cdot p$ (which shows the unit laws) and by associativity of multiplication, i.e. $(p\cdot q)\cdot h = p\cdot (h \cdot q)$ (which shows the associativity of the composition).
\end{exa}
The construction in \cref{exa:monoidofrationalnumbers} uses no specific properties of the rational numbers, only that it has a multiplication which is associative and such that there is a special element which does not change an element when it is multiplied with this special element. Hence, \cref{exa:monoidofrationalnumbers} can be generalized as follows:
\begin{dfn}\label{monoidcategory}
Recall that a monoid is a set $M$ equipped with binary operation $m : M \to M \to M$ which is associative, i.e. 
\[
\forall x,y,z\in M: m(x,m(y,z)) = m(m(x,y),z),
\]
and such that there is an identity element, i.e. 
\[
\exists e\in M: \forall x\in M: m(e,x)=x=m(x,e).
\]
Let $(M,m,e)$ be a monoid. The category $\MONtoCAT(M,m,e)$ is defined by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a unique object $\star$.
\item The (only) hom-set is given by 
\[
\Hom{\star}{\star} = M.
\]
\item The identity morphism on $\star$ is the identity element $e$.
\item The composition of morphisms $x$ and $y$ is given by $\co{x}{y} := m(x,y)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

That for each monoid $(M,m,e)$, $\MONtoCAT(M,m,e)$ is indeed a category, follows directly by the properties of being a monoid. Indeed, the axioms of a category become precisely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall x\in M: m(x,e)=x$,
\item $\forall x\in M: m(e,x)=x$,
\item $\forall x,y,z\in M: m(m(x,y),z) = m(x,m(y,z))$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{rem} Notice that this category illustrates that there is no relation between the collection of objects and the hom-sets since there is now only one object and the collection of the hom-set can be as small or as large as possible.
In fact, we can associate a different number of categories to a single monoid. We can for example consider an arbitrary set of objects $I$ and the defining the hom-sets as follows:
\[
\Hom{i}{j} := 
\begin{cases}
M ,\quad \text{ if } i=j,\\
\emptyset, \quad \text{ if } i\not=j.
\end{cases}
\]

  \end{itemize}
  The category $\op\CC$ is called the \textbf{opposite (category)} of $\CC$.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer} Let $G$ be a directed graph. Then $G$ induces a category $\mathbf{Graph}(G)$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The collection of objects $\Ob{\mathbf{Graph}(G)}$ is the set of vertices of $G$. 
\item The morphisms between object are the (directed) paths, that is, finite sequences of composable edges, between them.
\item For each object $x$ (i.e. vertex), the identity morphism on $x$ is the \textit{identity path}.
\item The composition of morphisms is the composition of paths.
\end{itemize}
We call $\mathbf{Graph}(G)$ the \textbf{category generated by $G$}. Show that $\mathbf{Graph}(G)$ is indeed a category.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer} Argue why the morphisms are chosen to be paths and it is not sufficient to just take the edges. 
\end{exer}

\begin{exa}\label{exa:graph_terminalcat} Consider the following graph $G$:
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
x
\end{tikzcd}
\]
i.e. the graph with only object vertex and no edges. The category generated by $G$ is the category generated is the so-called \textit{terminal category}, that is, the category with a single object and a single morphism (the identity morphism of the unique object). 
The terminal category is denoted by $\bullet$.

\end{exa}

In the following example we use the following notation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f$ is a morphism in a category, we denote $f^{2} := \co{f}{f}, f^{3} := \co{f}{f^2}$, etc.
\item We also label the edges in order to refer to them.

\[
\begin{tikzcd}
x \arrow[r, "f", bend left] & y \arrow[l, "g", bend left]

\]
The category generated by $G$ consists of the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The collection of objects is $\{x,y\}$.
\item The hom-sets are given as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Hom{x}{x}$ contains
\[
\Id[x], \co{f}{g}, (\co{f}{g})^2, (\co{f}{g})^3, \cdots,
\]
But these are not the only ones, we also have that each of these can be precomposed or postcomposed with $\Id[x]$, however, by the unit laws, we know that these don't give us any \textit{new} morphisms. The same remark holds for the associativity law. This comment also holds for the upcoming hom-sets.
\item $\Hom{y}{y}$ contains
\[
\Id[y], \co{g}{f}, (\co{g}{f})^2, (\co{g}{f})^3, \cdots,
\]
\item $\Hom{x}{y}$ contains  
\[

\]
\item $\Hom{y}{x}$ contains

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The category $\POS(\NN, \leq)$ generated by the preorder on natural numbers given by the ``less than or equal'' relation (the category that looks like this: $0 \to 1 \to 2 \to \ldots$).
  \item The category $\SKELFINSET$, where a morphism $f : m \to n$ is a function from the ``standard finite set'' $[m]$ to the standard finite set $[n]$. Here, $[m] := \{0,\ldots,m-1\}$.
  \item The category $\MAT$, where a morphism $f : m \to n$ is a real matrix of dimension $n \times m$ (with $n$ rows and $m$ columns).
    Such matrices can represent linear maps between real vector spaces.
    Composition in this category is given by matrix multiplication.

    More generally for each field $\mathbb{F}$, one can define $\MAT_\mathbb{F}$, where a morphism $f : m \to n$ is a an $n \times m$ matrix over the field $\mathbb{F}$.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Isomorphisms}
\label{sec:isos}

\begin{reading*}
  In this section, we study properties of arrows in a category.
  More information on this topic is given in \cite[\S 2.7]{barr-wells}.

  Also, \cite[\S 2.2]{pierce} briefly discusses isomorphisms.
\end{reading*}


\begin{dfn}[Isomorphism]
  Given a category $\CC$, objects $a,b \in \Ob{\CC}$ and a morphism $f : a \to b$ in $\CC$, we say that $f$ is an \textbf{isomorphism} when there is a morphism $g : b \to a$ (in the other direction!) such that $f \Comp g = \Id$ and $g \Comp f = \Id$.
  We write $f : a \cong b$ for a morphism $f$ that is an isomorphism.

  In this case, we call $g$ the \textbf{inverse} of $f$ and $f$ the inverse of $g$. (The latter is justified by \cref{exer:inverse-iso}.)
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:inverse-iso}]\label{exer:inverse-iso}
  Show that if $f : a \to b$ is an isomorphism with inverse $g : b \to a$, then $g$ is an isomorphism with inverse $f$.

  Show that a morphism $f : a \to b$ in $\CC$ is an isomorphism \textbf{in at most one way}, that is, show that its inverse is unique if it exists.

  Show that the composition of two isomorphisms is an isomorphism.
\end{exer}
% \begin{rem} 
% Since any identity morphism is an isomorphism (check this!), we conclude by \cref{exer:compofiso} that given any category $\CC$, we always get a new category $isos(\CC)$ by restricting the morphisms to be isomorphisms, i.e. \[
% \Ob{isos(\CC)} = \Ob{\CC}, \quad \CHom{isos(\CC)}{X}{Y} = \left\{f \in \CHom{\CC}{X}{Y} \mid f \text{ is an isomorphism}\right\}
% \] 
% and where the identity and composition is the same as in $\CC$.

\section{Sections and Retractions}
\label{sec:sections}


\begin{dfn}[Section, Retraction]
  A pair $(s,r)$ of morphisms $s : a \to b$ and $r : b \to a$ in $\CC$ is called a \textbf{section-retraction pair} if $\co{s}{r} = \Id[a]$.

  In such a case, we call $s$ a section and $r$ a retraction.
\end{dfn}

\begin{rem}
  Note that a morphism can be a retraction in more than one way, that is, there can be more than one section $s$ such that $\co{s}{r} = \Id$.
\end{rem}

Intuitively, a section-retraction pair $(s,r)$ of morphisms $s : a \to b$ and $r : b \to a$ in a category $\CC$ provides a way for $a$ to ``live inside'' $b$.
Note that for a given $a$ and $b$ there can be many ways for $a$ to live inside $b$.

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:section-retraction-bool-int}]\label{exer:section-retraction-bool-int}
  Construct two different section-retraction pairs between the type |Bool| of booleans and the type |Int| of integers (e.g., in Haskell).
\end{exer}



\begin{exer}
 Show that the type |Maybe a| is a retract of the type |[a]|.

\section{Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms}
\label{sec:mono-epi}

\begin{reading*}
See also \cite[p. 134]{leinster} and \cite[\S\S 2.8--2.9]{barr-wells}.
Also, \cite[\S 2.2]{pierce} briefly discusses monomorphisms and epimorphisms.
\end{reading*}

From undergraduate mathematics courses you know what injective and surjective functions between sets are.
The definitions of ``injective'' and ``surjective'' do not carry over to any category (though they do for categories that are, in some sense, ``similar'' to the category of sets).
In this section, we study two properties of morphisms in a category that, in the category of sets, are equivalent to ``injective'' and ``surjective'', respectively.



\begin{dfn}[Monomorphism]
  Let $f : a \to b$ be a morphism in $\CC$. We say that $f$ is a \textbf{monomorphism} if, for any two morphisms $g_1, g_2 : z \to a$, like in the following diagram,
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    z \arrow[r, "g_2"', shift right] \arrow[r, "g_1", shift left] & a \arrow[r, "f"] & b
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  we have
  \[ \co{g_1}{f} = \co{g_2}{f} \text{ implies } g_1 = g_2 .\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:mono-inj}]\label{ex:mono-inj}
  In the category of sets, show that a morphism $f : X \to Y$ is a monomorphism if and only if it is injective.
\end{exer}

\begin{dfn}[Epi]
  Let $f : a \to b$ be a morphism in $\CC$. We say that $f$ is an \textbf{epimorphism} if, for any two morphisms $g_1, g_2 : b \to z$, like in the following diagram,
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
    a \arrow[r, "f"] & b \arrow[r, "g_2"', shift right] \arrow[r, "g_1", shift left] & z
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  we have
  \[ \co{f}{g_1} = \co{f}{g_2} \text{ implies } g_1 = g_2 .\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer}\label{ex:epi-surj}
  In the category of sets, show that a morphism $f : X \to Y$ is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective.
\end{exer}


\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:sections_in_set_injective}]\label{exer:sections_in_set_injective}

  Show that the converse of \cref{exer:iso_to_monoepi} does not hold in general, i.e. give an example of a category where there exists a morphism which is both an epi- and a monomorphism, but which is not an isomorphism.

Hint: Consider a preordered set.

\chapter{Universal Properties}\label{sec:universal}

In category theory, we study objects of a category by studying the ``interactions'' they have with other objects in the category.
What does this mean?
The only interactions we know between objects are the morphisms of the category.
Given an object of a category, we can ask what the morphisms out of this object, and into this object, are.
More generally, we can ask what the morphisms out of, or into, an object are that make some given diagrams commute.
We usually are interested in objects such that there exists a unique morphism out of it, or into it, such that a given diagram commutes.
We say that this object satisfies a ``universal property''.

This description is very vague and abstract; it will hopefully be clearer once we have looked at some specific universal properties.
The first universal property is that of \emph{initiality}.

\begin{reading*}
  On initial and terminal objects, see also \cite[\S 2.7.16]{barr-wells} and \cite[p. 48ff]{leinster}.

  Products and coproducts, other special limits and colimits, and the general definition of limits and colimits, are discussed in \cite[\S\S 5.1, 5.2]{leinster}.

  Pierce's tutorial discusses the (co)limits defined here in \cite[\S\S 2.3--2.4]{pierce}, and further (co)limits in  \cite[\S\S 2.5--2.7]{pierce}.

\section{Initial Objects}
\label{sec:initial-objects}

We say that an object of a category $\CC$ is \emph{initial} if it has a unique morphism to any object in the category:

\begin{dfn}
  Let $\CC$ be a category. An object $A \in \Ob{\CC}$ is \textbf{initial} if there is exactly one morphism from $A$ to any object $B \in \Ob{\CC}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{explanation}[about \textbf{Unique Existence}]
  When you need to show that there exists a unique thing with some property, there are two things to prove:
  \begin{description}
  \item[Existence] You need to construct a thing and show that it has the desired property.
  \item[Uniqueness] You need to show that any (abstract) thing that has the desired property is equal to the thing you have constructed. Equivalently, you can show that any two abstract things with the desired property are equal.
  \end{description}
\end{explanation}


We look at some specific categories, and try to identify initial objects in them.
These examples might seem a tad boring to you;
indeed, in ``simple'' categories, initial objects are usually quite simple as well.
However, in more complicated categories---that is, in categories where the objects and morphisms are complicated---an initial object can be very interesting; see, for instance, \cref{sec:initial-algs}.

\begin{exer}
  Does the category $\bullet$ (the terminal category defined in \cref{exa:graph_terminalcat}) have an initial object?
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Does the category 
  \[ 
  \begin{tikzcd}
  	A & B
  \end{tikzcd}  
   \] 
  have an initial object?
\end{exer}


\begin{exer}
  Does the category $A \to B$ have an initial object?
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Does the category $A \rightleftarrows B$ have an initial object? (Here, the morphism $A \to B$ is inverse to the morphism $B \to A$.)
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Does the category $A \rightrightarrows B$ have an initial object?
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Does the category 
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
  A \arrow[r] \arrow[loop, swap, looseness=4, "f"] & B
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
  have an initial object? (Here, the morphism $f$ is different from $\Id[A]$).
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initial_set}]\label{exer:initial_set}
  Identify an initial object in the category $\SET$ of sets.
  Prove that it is indeed initial.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}

  Prove that it is indeed initial.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initial_posetcat}]\label{exer:initial_posetcat}
  Let $(X,\leq)$ be a poset. Describe what an initial object looks like in  $\POS(X,\leq)$.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initial-unique}]\label{exer:initial-unique}
  Let $A$ and $A'$ be initial objects in $\CC$. Construct an isomorphism $i : A \cong A'$.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initiality_preserved_by_iso}]\label{exer:initiality_preserved_by_iso}
  Let $A$ be an initial object in $\CC$, and let $A'$ be isomorphic to $A$ (via an isomorphism $i : A \cong A'$).
  Show that $A'$ is an initial object of $\CC$.
\end{exer}

\begin{rem}
  \Cref{exer:initial-unique} shows that initial objects in a category $\CC$ are \textbf{essentially unique}, that is, they are \textbf{unique up to (unique) isomorphism}.

  
  This justifies using the determinate article: we will say that $A$ is \textbf{the} initial object of $\CC$.

  
  This is more generally the case for any object with a universal property, see, e.g., \cref{exer:terminal-unique,exer:product-unique}.
\end{rem}

  Construct a category that does not have an initial object.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initial_pointset}]\label{exer:initial_pointset} Let $\PTSET$ be the category of pointed sets, that is the category whose objects are pairs $(X,x)$ with $X$ a set and $x\in X$ and a morphism from $(X,x)$ to $(Y,y)$ is defined as a function $f:X\to Y$ such that $f(x)=y$. Identify an initial object in $\PTSET$.
\end{exer}

\end{exer}

\begin{exer}[\cref{sol:initial_rel}] \label{exer:initial_rel}
Identify an initial object in the category $\REL$ and show that it is initial.
\end{exer}

\begin{rem}
  The concept of initial object seems trivial and boring in the categories considered above.
  However, in complicated categories, initial objects can be complicated and exciting;
  we will see this in \cref{sec:initial-algs}.
\end{rem}

\section{Terminal Objects}

\section{(Binary) Products}
\label{sec:products}



\begin{dfn}\label{def:binproduct}
  Let $\CC$ be a category and let $A,B \in \Ob\CC$ be objects of $\CC$.

  A triple $(P,\projl : P \to A ,\projr : P \to B)$ is called a \textbf{product of $A$ and $B$} if for any triple $(Q,q_1 : Q \to A, q_2 : Q \to B)$ there is exactly one morphism $f : Q \to P$ such that the following diagram commutes:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}

\begin{dfn}
   Let $\CC$ be a category and let $A,B \in \Ob\CC$ be objects of $\CC$.

  A triple $(C,\inl : A \to C,\inr : B \to C)$ is called a \textbf{coproduct of $A$ and $B$} if for any triple $(D,i_l : A \to D, i_r : B \to D)$ there is exactly one morphism $f : C \to D$ such that the following diagram commutes:

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma}
Given category $\CC$ with choice of coproduct, objects $A,B\in \Ob{\CC}$, their coproduct $(A+B,\inl,\inr)$ and a morphism $f:A+B\to A+B$. If $\co {\inl} {f}=\inl$ and $\co {\inr} {f}=\inr$, then $f=\Id[A+B]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By definition of coproduct $A+B$ we know there is a unique $g: A+B \to A+B$, s.t. $\co {\inl} {g}=\inl$ and $\co {\inr} {g}=\inr$. Since it is unique, $f$ and $g$ must be the same morphism. Furthermore, we know that the identity morphism $\Id[A+B]: A+B \to A+B$ exists, and satisfies the equations $\co {\inl} {\Id[A+B]} = \inl$ and $\co {\inr} {\Id[A+B]} = \inr$. Again because of uniqueness of $g$, $\Id[A+B]$ must be the same as $g$, therefore $f=g=\Id[A+B]$.

\chapter{Functors}\label{sec:functors}
An important aspect in computer programming is the transformation of data. For example, if you have a data type $X$, then one can consider also the data type $\List(X)$ of lists with values in $X$. If one thinks of the objects in a category to be data types, then we can ask even more. If $f:X\to Y$ is a function (between the data types), then this also induces  a function from the $X$-valued lists to the $Y$-valued lists as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:function_on_list}
  \List(f) : \List(X)&\to \List(Y)
  \\
  [x_1,\ldots x_n] &\mapsto [f(x_1),\ldots,f(x_n)]. \notag
\end{align}

\begin{rem}
  The ``\ldots'' above are informal --- a formal definition would define $\List(f)$ by structural recursion on lists, of course.
\end{rem}

A \textit{functor} formalizes this phenomenon:
\begin{dfn} Let $\CC$ and $\DD$ be categories. A \textbf{functor} $F$ from $\CC$ to $\DD$ consists of the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item A function 
\[
\Ob{\CC} \to \Ob{\DD},
\]
written as $X\mapsto F(X)$.
\item For each $X,Y\in \Ob{\CC}$, a function
\[
\CHom{\CC}{X}{Y} \to \CHom{\DD}{F(X)}{F(Y)},
\]
written as $f\mapsto F(f)$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, this data should satisfy the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item (\textbf{Preserves composition}) For $f\in \Hom[\CC]{X}{Y}$ and $g\in \Hom[\CC]{Y}{Z}$, we have $F(\co f g) = \co {Ff}{Fg}$.
\item (\textbf{Preserves identity}) For $X\in\CC$, we have $F(\Id[X]) = \Id[F(X)]$.
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{rem}[Explanation]
	A function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ maps every element of $X$, to an element in $Y$.
	Analogously, a \emph{functor} from a category $\CC$ to a category $\DD$ maps every object of $\CC$ to an object in $\DD$.
	(This is the first piece of data in the definition of a functor; made formal as a function between the underlying types/collections/sets of objects.)
	However, a category does not only consist of a set of objects.
	(Indeed, between every two objects $c_1, c_2 \in \Ob{\CC}$, we have a set of morphisms; denoted $\CHom{\CC}{x}{y}$).
	Hence, a functor, as a ``morphism'' between categories, should also map every morphism in $\CC$ to a morphism in $\DD$ (while suitably preserving domain and codomain of the morphism).
	(This is the second piece of data in the definition of a functor.)
	
	In the examples and exercises below, the first piece (i.\,e.,\, the function between the collection of objects) is always given.
	(Why? Because between fixed categories, there may be many functors, or none.)
	While the second piece of data is not uniquely determined by the function between the object-sets, there is often a canonical (obvious) choice.
	Below, we ask the reader to find the canonical choice.
	A functor is completely determined by the function (or action) on objects and morphisms.
	However, in order to guarantee that these functions are well-behaved (w.\,r.\,t.,\, to the structure given by the categories), we furthermore require that the composition and identity are preserved.
They need to be checked to complete the definition of a functor.
	(Often, these properties hold by construction; that is, by unfolding the data, provided in the second piece.)
\end{rem}

\begin{exa} \label{example:functor_list} The \textbf{list-functor} (on sets), denoted by $\List$, is the functor from $\SET$ to $\SET$ defined by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The function on objects is given by:
\[
\Ob{\SET}\to \Ob{\SET}: X\mapsto \List(X).
\]
\item For each $X,Y\in\SET$, the function on morphisms is given by
\[
\CHom{\SET}{X}{Y} \to \CHom{\SET}{\List(X)}{\List(Y)}: f\mapsto \List(f),
\]
where $\mathbf{List}(f)$ is given in \cref{eqn:function_on_list}.
\end{itemize}


\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
The data is clearly well-defined since we work with \textit{mere} sets, i.e. no extra structure. That $\List$ would preserve the identity means that $\List(\Id[X]) = \Id[\List(X)]$, i.e. we have to show that for each $X$-valued list $\ell$, we have:
\[
\List(\Id[X])(\ell)) = \Id[\List(X)](A)(\ell).
\] 
The lefthand-side of the equation is given by:
$$\mathbf{List}(\Id[X])(\{x_i\}_i) = \{\Id[X] (x_i)\}_i = \{x_i\}_i,$$
where the first (resp. second) equality holds by definition of $\mathbf{List}$ on morphisms (resp. by definition of $\Id[X]$).\\
The righthand-side of the equation is given by:
$$\Id[\mathbf{List}(X)](A)(\{x_i\}_i) = \{x_i\}_i,$$
by definition of the identity morphism in $\SET$. Hence, the left and right hand side are equal which shows that $\mathbf{List}$ indeed preserves the identity.\\
We now show that $\mathbf{List}$ preserves composition. Let $f\in \CHom{\SET}{X}{Y}$ and $g\in \CHom{\SET}{Y}{Z}$ be functions. By definition of the composition in $\SET$ and by definition of $\mathbf{List}$ on morphisms, we have for each $X$-valued list $\{x_i\}_i$:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:functor_list_comp1}
\mathbf{List}(f\Comp g)(\{x_i\}_i) = \{(f\Comp g)(x_i)\}_i = \{g(f(x_i)\}_i.
\end{eqnarray}
Again by definition of the composition in $\SET$ and by definition of $\mathbf{List}$ on morphisms, we have for each $X$-valued list $\{x_i\}_i$:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:functor_list_comp2}
\left(\mathbf{List}(f)\Comp \mathbf{List}(g)\right)(\{x_i\}_i) = \mathbf{List}(g)\left(\{f(x_i)\}_i\right) = \{g(f(x_i)\}_i.
\end{eqnarray}
Hence, by combining \cref{eqn:functor_list_comp1, eqn:functor_list_comp2}, we conclude that for each $X$-valued list $\{x_i\}_i$ we have
\[
\mathbf{List}(f\Comp g)(\{x_i\}_i) = \left(\mathbf{List}(f)\Comp \mathbf{List}(g)\right)(\{x_i\}_i).
\]
Since this holds for every such list, we indeed have that the composition is preserved.
\end{proof}

\section{Categories as Objects of a Category?}
Notice that a functor is a function between categories which preserves the structure of a category. So by the \textit{philosophy} of category theory, this would define a category whose objects are categories and whose morphisms are functors. In order to make this precise, we would also need a \textit{identity functor} and we should have a \textit{composition of functors}.

\begin{exa}\label{example:functor_id} Let $\CC$ be a category. The \textbf{identity functor on $\CC$}, denoted by $\Id[\CC]$, is the functor specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The function on objects is given by
\[
\Ob{\CC}\to \Ob{\CC}: X\mapsto X.
\]
\item For each $X,Y\in\CC$, the function on morphisms is given by
\[
\CHom \CC X Y\to \CHom \CC X Y: f\mapsto f.
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{exa}

\begin{exer} Show that $\Id[\CC]$ (defined in \cref{example:functor_id}) satisfies the properties of a functor, i.e. $\Id[\CC]$ is indeed a functor.
\end{exer}

\begin{exa}\label{example:functor_comp} Let $\CC,\DD$ and $\EE$ be  categories and $F:\CC\to\DD$ and $G:\DD\to\EE$ functors. The \textbf{composition functor of $F$ with $G$}, denoted by $F\Comp G$, is the functor specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The function on objects is given by
\[
\Ob{\CC}\to \Ob{\EE}: X\mapsto G(F(X)).
\]
\item For each $X,Y\in\CC$, the function on morphisms is given by
\[
\CHom \CC X Y\to \CHom{\EE}{G(F(X))}{G(F(Y))}: f\mapsto G(F(f)).
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{exa}

\begin{exer} Show that $F\Comp G$ (defined in \cref{example:functor_comp}) satisfies the properties of a functor, i.e. $F\Comp G$ is indeed a functor.
\end{exer}

\begin{dfn} The \textbf{category of categories}, denoted by $\CAT$, is the category specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a category.
\item If $\CC, \DD\in\CAT$ are categories, then is $\CHom \CAT \CC \DD$ the collection of all functors from $\CC$ to $\DD$.
\item The identity morphism on a category $\CC$ is the identity functor on $\CC$ defined in \cref{example:functor_id}.
\item The composition of morphisms, i.e. functors, is the composition of functors defined in \cref{example:functor_comp}.
\end{itemize} 
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that $\CAT$ satisfies the property of a category, i.e. $\CAT$ is indeed a category.
\end{exer}

\begin{rem}
  When showing that $\CAT$ is a category, one is forced to consider \emph{equality of objects} when showing that two functors are equal.
  This goes against the spirit of category theory, where we only ever consider \emph{equality of (parallel) morphisms}.
  We want to consider two objects ``the same'' when they are \emph{isomorphic}, not when they are \emph{equal}. Of course, any two equal objects are isomorphic to each other, but not the other way round; for instance, in the category of sets, the cartesian product $A \times B$ is isomorphic to $B \times A$, but they are not equal.

  To stay within the spirit of category theory, one can instead consider $\CAT$ as a \textbf{bicategory}.%
  \footnote{See, e.g.,   \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bicategory\#detailedDefn} for a definition of bicategories.}
  In a bicategory, one has one more layer of things: objects, morphisms, and 2-cells between parallel morphisms. One also calls objects ``0-cells'' and morphisms ``1-cells'', for consistency.
  Importantly, in a bicategory, the laws concerning 1-cells (as stated in \cref{dfn:category}) do not hold up to equality, but only up to isomorphism of 2-cells.

  An important example is the bicategory given by the following data, which we only list partially:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item 0-cells are categories;
  \item 1-cells are functors;
  \item 2-cells are natural transformations (see \cref{sec:nat-trans});
  \item composition and identity of 1-cells is composition and identity of functors.
  \end{enumerate}

  We do not delve into bicategories in these notes; an introductory text is, for instance, Leinster's \cite{leinster:basic-bicats}.
\end{rem}




\chapter{Natural Transformations}
\label{sec:nat-trans}

\begin{dfn} Let $F,G: \CC\to\DD$ be functors. A \textbf{natural transformation} $\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$ consists of the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item For each $X\in \Ob{\CC}$, a morphism $\alpha_X \in \CHom{\DD}{F(X)}{G(X)}$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, this data should satisfy the following \textit{naturality condition}:\\
For each $f\in \CHom{\CC}{X}{Y}$, the following diagram should commute:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
F(X) \arrow[r, "\alpha_X"] \arrow[d,swap, "F(f)"] & G(X) \arrow[d, "G(f)"]\\
F(Y) \arrow[r,swap, "\alpha_Y"] & G(Y)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Moreover, we call $\alpha$ a \textbf{natural isomorphism} if for each $X\in\Ob{\CC}$, we have that $\alpha_X$ is an isomorphism in $\DD$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{nota} If $F,G:\CC\to\DD$ are functors, a natural transformation $\alpha$ from $F$ to $G$ is denoted as $\NatTrans{\alpha}{F}{G}$ or 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=huge]
\CC
  \arrow[bend left=50]{r}[name=U,label=above:$\scriptstyle F$]{}
  \arrow[bend right=50]{r}[name=D,label=below:$\scriptstyle G$]{} &

  \arrow[shorten <=5pt, Rightarrow,to path={(U) -- node[label=right:$\alpha$] {} (D)}]{}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{nota}

\begin{exa} (\textbf{Currying}) Let $X$ be a set. Let $F := \SET(X, -)\times X : \SET\to\SET$ be the functor induced by the following data (on objects):
\[
Y\mapsto \SET(X,Y)\times X.
\]
The evaluation defines a natural transformation $\NatTrans{ev}{F}{\Id[\SET]}$ as follows:
\[
ev_Y : \SET(X,Y) \times X \to Y : (f,x) \mapsto f(x).
\]
Show that this indeed satisfies the naturality condition.
\end{exa}

\begin{exer}
  Given two preordered sets $(X,\leq_X)$ and $(Y, \leq_Y)$ and two functors $f, g : \PREtoCAT(X,\leq_X) \to \PREtoCAT(Y,\leq_Y)$ between their associated categories, what is a natural transformation from $f$ to $g$?
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Can you define a natural transformation that counts the occurrences of elements from $X$ in a list?

\subsection{Functor Categories}
\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:nattrans_id} Let $F:\CC\to\DD$ be a functor. The \textbf{identity natural transformation} $\Id[F]$ on $F$ is given by the following data:
\[
\forall X\in\Ob{\CC}: (\Id[F])_{X} := \Id[F(x)].
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that for any functor $F:\CC\to\DD$, the identity natural transformation $\Id[F]$ satisfies the properties of a natural transformation.

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:nattrans_comp} Let $F,G,H: \CC\to\DD$ be functors and $\NatTrans{\alpha}{F}{G}$, $\NatTrans{\beta}{G}{H}$ be natural transformations.

\[
\forall X\in\Ob{\CC}: (\co{\alpha}{\beta})_{X} := \co{\alpha_X}{\beta_X}.
\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that for any functors $F,G,H: \CC\to\DD$ and $\NatTrans{\alpha}{F}{G}$, $\NatTrans{\beta}{G}{H}$ natural transformations, the (vertical) composition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfies the properties of a natural transformation.
\end{exer}

\begin{dfn} Let $\CC,\DD$ be categories. The \textbf{category of functors} or the \textbf{functor category} from $\CC\to\DD$, denoted by $Fun(\CC,\DD)$ or $[\CC,\DD]$, is given by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item An object is a functor $F:\CC\to\DD$.
\item Given functors $F, G:\CC\to\DD$, a morphism from $F$ to $G$ is a natural transformation $\NatTrans{\alpha}{F}{G}$.
\item The identity morphism on $F$ is given by the identity natural transformation $\Id[F]$ defined in \cref{dfn:nattrans_id}.
\item The composition of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is given by the composition $\co{\alpha}{\beta}$ defined in \cref{dfn:nattrans_comp}.
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that for any two categories $\CC$ and $\DD$, the functor category from $\CC$ to $\DD$ satisfies the properties of a category.
\end{exer}

\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:nattrans_horcomp} Let $F,G : \CC\to\DD$ and $\tilde{F},\tilde{G}:\DD\to\EE$ be functors and $\NatTrans{\alpha}{F}{G}, \NatTrans{\beta}{\tilde{F}}{\tilde{G}}$ be natural transformations. The \textbf{horizontal composition} (also called the \textbf{Godement product}) of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, denoted by $\beta \bullet \alpha$, is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nattrans_horcomp}
\forall X\in \Ob{\CC}: (\beta\bullet\alpha)_X := \co{\tilde{F}(\alpha_X)}{\beta_{G(X)}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Exercises}
\begin{exer}
  Let $(M,m,e)$ be a monoid and let $\MONtoCAT(M,m,e)$ be its corresponding category. Recall from \cref{ex:monoid_functors} that a functor from $\MONtoCAT(M,m,e)$ to $\SET$ is a set $X$ together with an action of $M$ on $X$, i.e. a function $\mu: M\times X\to X$ such that 
  \[
    \forall x\in X: \mu(e,x) = x, \quad \forall n_1,n_2\in M, x\in X: \mu(n_1, \mu(n_2,x)) = \mu(m(n_1,n_2), x).
  \]
  We will call a set $ X $ with an action of $ M $ on $ X $ an $ M $-set.
  Describe the natural transformations between $M$-sets.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Let $(X,\leq_X)$ and $(Y,\leq_Y)$ be posets.
  Recall from \cref{ex:poset_functors} that a functor between posets corresponds with an order-preserving function, i.e. $x_1 \leq_X x_2 \implies f(x_1) \leq_Y f(x_2)$.
  Describe the natural transformations between order-preserving functions.
\end{exer}

\section{Equivalence of Categories}
Recall that objects $X,Y\in\Ob{\CC}$ are isomorphic if there exist morphisms $f\in\CHom{C}{X}{Y}$ and $g\in\CHom{C}{Y}{X}$ such that $\co{f}{g} = \Id[X]$ and $\co{g}{f} = \Id[Y]$. So in particular we have the notion of an isomorphism in the category $\CAT$ of categories. Spelled out, this means categories $\CC$ and $\DD$ are isomorphic if there exist functors $F:\CC\to\DD$ and $G:\CC\to\DD$ such that $\co{F}{G}= \Id[\CC]$ and $\co{G}{F} = \Id[\DD]$.\\
However, the following exercise shows that isomorphism of categories is not the correct notion of \textit{equivalence/sameness} between categories:\\
Let $\FINSET$ be the category whose objects are given by finite sets and whose morphisms are given by functions\footnote{Notice that the objects of $\FINSET$ form a subset of the objects of $\SET$, but given any two finite sets $X,Y \in \Ob{\FINSET}$, we have $\CHom{\FINSET}{X}{Y}$ = $\CHom{\SET}{X}{Y}$. We say in this case that $\FINSET$ is a (full) subcategory of $\SET$.}. That this is a category follows since $\SET$ is a category.\\
Let $\Catb{FinOrd}$ be the category whose objects are given by sets of the form 
\[
[n] := \left\{0,1,\cdots,n-1\right\},
\]
and whose morphisms are given by functions between these sets.\\
Every finite set $X$ is always in bijection with a set of the form $[n]$ (where $n$ is the size $\vert X\vert$ of $X$). For each set $X$, we fix a bijection $\phi^X: X\to [\vert X\vert]$. Consequently, we have a functor:
\begin{dfn} Let $U: \FINSET\to \Catb{FinOrd}$ be the functor specified by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $X\in \Ob{\FINSET}$, we define $U(X) := [\vert X\vert]$.
\item For $f\in \CHom{\FINSET}{X}{Y}$, we define $U(f): [\vert X\vert]\to [\vert Y\vert]$ as the unique function such that the following diagram commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[r, "\phi^X"] \arrow[d,swap, "f"] & {[\vert X\vert]} \arrow[d, "U(f)"] \\
Y \arrow[r,swap, "\phi^Y"] & {[\vert Y\vert]}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that $U: \FINSET\to \Catb{FinOrd}$ is indeed a functor. In particular, you have to show that $U$ is well-defined on the morphisms.
\end{exer}

In order to show that $U$ is not an isomorphism, one can use the following lemma/exercise:
\begin{exer} Show that a functor $F:\CC\to\DD$ is an isomorphism if and only if $F$ satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F$ is injective on objects, i.e. 
\[
\forall X,Y\in\Ob{\CC}: F(X) = F(Y) \implies X=Y.
\]
\item $F$ is surjective on objects, i.e. 
\[
\forall Y\in\Ob{\DD}: \exists X\in\Ob{\CC} : F(X) = Y.
\]
\item $F$ is faithful, i.e. the following functions are injective
\[
\forall X,Y\in\Ob{\CC}: \CHom{\CC}{X}{Y} \xrightarrow{F_{X,Y}} \CHom{\DD}{F(X)}{F(Y)} : f\mapsto F(f)
\]
\item $F$ is full, i.e. for all $X,Y\in \Ob{\CC}$, $F_{X,Y}$ is surjective.
\end{itemize}
\end{exer}

\begin{exer} Show that $U$ is not an isomorphism, i.e. state which part of an isomorphism fails and give a concrete example that it fails.
\end{exer}

\begin{rem} The problem with $U$ (in the sense that it is not an isomorphism) is that multiple (finite) sets are mapped to the same set. For this reason, a good notion of equivalence between categories should not be injective on objects. Also, which is not clear from this example, we should also weaken the condition of $F$ being surjective on objects. Instead, we need that $F$ is \textbf{essentially surjective on objects}:
\[
\forall Y\in\Ob{\DD}: \exists X\in\Ob{\CC} : F(X) \cong Y.
\]
\end{rem}
Motivated by the remark, we define:
\begin{dfn} Categories $\CC$ and $\DD$ are \textbf{equivalent} if there exists a pair of functors $(F:\CC\to\DD, G:\DD\to\CC)$ such that there exists natural isomorphisms 
\[
\co{F}{G} \to \Id[\CC], \quad \co{G}{F} \to \Id[\DD]
\]
\end{dfn}

So, although $U$ is not an isomorphism, it does induce an equivalence of categories:
\begin{exer} Show that $U$ induces an equivalence of categories.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer} Let $\CC$ be the category whose objects are categories with a unique object and whose morphisms are functors between these one-object categories, i.e. $\CC$ is the (full) subcategory of $\CAT$ generated by the categories with a unique object. Show that $\CC$ is equivalent to the category $\MON$ of monoids.
\end{exer}
\begin{exer}
In the previous exercise, what happens if we do not consider $\CC$ to consist of those categories with a unique object, but with a unique object up to isomorphism? In other words, consider $\CC$ as the category whose objects are categories $\DD$ which satisfy the following property: 
\[
\forall X,Y \in \Ob{\DD}: X\cong Y.
\]
\end{exer}

The following exercise gives a characterization of a functor being an equivalence. However, in order to show this, one has to use the axiom of choice which means (informally) that if the following property holds:
\[ 
\exists x: P(x),
\]
then we can fix some $x$ such that $P(x)$ holds.
\begin{exer} Show that a functor $F:\CC\to\DD$ induces an equivalence of categories if and only if it is essentially surjective on objects and fully faithful.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  Show that the category $\MAT$ is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional real vector spaces and linear maps.
\end{exer}

\chapter{Conclusions and Further Reading}

We have given a brief, and necessarily incomplete, introduction to category theory.
The choice of topics was guided by the applications to programming we considered.
 Here below, we list a few avenues for further exploration; this list is curated with a view towards pedagogy rather than scientific completeness.
\begin{itemize}
\item Altenkirch and Reus show how the lambda calculus forms a monad.
  (This can be generalized to other languages, including languages with simple types, see, e.g., \cite{DBLP:journals/jfrea/AhrensZ11}.)
\item For \emph{nested} datatypes, the iteration principle of \cref{sec:datatypes-as-initial} is often not enough; Bird and Paterson~\cite{DBLP:journals/fac/BirdP99} develop a \emph{generalized} fold operator for nested datatypes.
\item Some functions cannot be straightforwardly defined using the simple iteration scheme of \cref{sec:datatypes-as-initial}; for instance, the factorial function does not adhere to the required pattern.
  Vene~\cite{vene_phd} studies more general recursion schemes beyond the iteration (catamorphisms) of~\cref{sec:datatypes-as-initial}.
\item Harper~\cite{DBLP:phd/ethos/Harper13} develops a unifying framework for shortcut fusion.

\end{itemize}
