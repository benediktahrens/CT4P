\label{sec:monads}

In this section, we study the definition of monads as well as instances of monads useful in functional programming.

There are different, equivalent, definitions of monads.
Since these definitions are equivalent, we can use them interchangeably once we have understood them.
But at first we need to distinguish them, and hence need different names for each definition; we choose to call one definition ``Kleisli triple'' or ``extension system'' (see \cref{def:kleisli-triple}) and one ``monad'' (see \cref{def:monad}).
Whenever we want to gloss over the precise definition, we simply say ``monad''.


Recall that a monad (as defined, e.g., in Haskell) is a function |m :: * -> *| together with the additional data of a function |pure :: a -> m a| (for each type |a|) and a function |(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b| (for types |a| and |b|).
The operations |pure| and |(>>=)| are expected to satisfy the following laws:
\begin{enumerate}
\item |t >>= pure == t| %$\bind(X, pure) = X$.
\item |pure(x) >>= f == f x| %$bind(pure(X), f) = f(X)$.
\item |(t >>= f) >>= g == t >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)|% $bind(bind(X,f), g) = bind(X, \lambda x. bind(f(x), g)$.
\end{enumerate}
However, these laws cannot be enforced in Haskell, since Haskell does not have any infrastructure for equational reasoning.
(The laws could be tested for using Quickcheck or a similar framework.)

In a category, however, we can define monads including the monad laws.
As mentioned above, we give two different definitions of monad;
one called ``Kleisli triple'' (\cref{def:kleisli-triple}), which corresponds to what is called ``monad'' in Haskell,
and one called ``monad'' (\cref{def:monad}). 

%The formulation of monads uses the fact that the arguments to |(>>=)| can be reordered.

\begin{dfn}\label{def:kleisli-triple}
  A \textbf{Kleisli triple} over a category $\CC$ is  consisting of the following data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A function $T: \Ob{\CC}\to \Ob{\CC}$.
\item For each $X\in\Ob{\CC}$, a morphism $\eta_X \in \CHom{\CC}{X}{T(X)}$.
\item For each $f\in\CHom{\CC}{X}{T(Y)}$, a morphism $f^{*} \in \CHom{\CC}{T(X)}{T(Y)}$.
\end{enumerate}
such that the following properties holds:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item For each $X \in \Ob\CC$, we have $\eta_X^{*} = \Id[T(X)]$.
\item For each $f\in\CHom{\CC}{X}{T(Y)}$, the following diagram commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
X \arrow[r, "{\eta_X}"] \arrow[rd,swap,"f"] & T(X) \arrow[d, "f^{*}"] \\
& T(Y)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\item For each $f\in\CHom{\CC}{X}{T(Y)}$ and $g\in\CHom{\CC}{Y}{T(Z)}$, the following diagram commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
T(X) \arrow[r, "f^{*}"] \arrow[rd,swap,"{(\co{f}{g^{*}})^{*}}"] & T(Y) \arrow[d, "g^{*}"] \\
& T(Z)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
We denote a Kleisli triple as $(T,\eta, (-)^{*})$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer}
  Convince yourself that the operations and laws of a Kleisli triple correspond, in the category $\HASK$, to the operations and properties of a monad in Haskell.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}

\]
where $\BinTree(X)$ is the set of binary trees labelled with elements from $X$ at the leaves, that is the set inductively generated by the constructors $\mathsf{leaf}: X\to \BinTree(X)$ and $\mathsf{branch} : \BinTree(X)\to \BinTree(X)\to \BinTree(X)$.

\begin{reading*}
  Moggi \cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Moggi91} defines a syntax, or rather, several syntaxes, for programming languages with categorical semantics in monads such as the ones above.
  The basic idea, taken verbatim from Moggi's paper, is as follows:
  \begin{quote}
    The basic idea behind the categorical semantics below is that, in order to interpret a programming language in a category $\CC$, we distinguish the object $A$ of values (of type $A$) from the object $T A$ of computations (of type $A$), and take as denotations of programs (of type $A$) the \emph{elements} of $T A$.
In particular, we identify the type $A$ with the object of values (of type $A$) and obtain the object
of computations (of type $A$) by applying an unary type-constructor $T$ to $A$. We call $T$ a \emph{notion of computation}, since it abstracts away from the type of values computations may produce. There are many choices for $T A$ corresponding to different notions of computations.
  \end{quote}

  More information about monads and effects is also given in \cite{DBLP:conf/ac/BentonHM00}.
\end{reading*}



The notion of a Kleisli triple can equivalently be described  as follows:
\begin{dfn}\label{def:monad}
A \textbf{monad} over a category $\CC$ consists of the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item A (endo)functor $T:\CC\to\CC$.
\item A natural transformation (``unit'') $\NatTrans{\eta}{\Id[\CC]}{T}$.
\item A natural transformation (``multiplication'') $\NatTrans{\mu}{\co{T}{T}}{T}$.
\end{itemize}
such that for each $X\in\Ob{\CC}$ the following diagrams commute (``associativity'' and ``unit'' laws):
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
T^3(X) \arrow[r, "\mu_{T(X)}"] \arrow[d,swap, "T(\mu_X)"] & T^2(X) \arrow[d, "\mu_X"] \\
T^2(X) \arrow[r,swap, "\mu_X"] & T(X)
\end{tikzcd}
\quad
\begin{tikzcd} 
T(X) \arrow[r, "{\eta_{T(X)}}"] \arrow[rd,swap, "{\Id[T(X)]}"] 
& T^2(X) \arrow[d,"{\mu_X}"] & T(X) \arrow[l,swap,"{T(\mu_X)}"] \arrow[ld, "{\Id[T(X)]}"] \\
& T(X) &
\end{tikzcd}

\end{center}
where we denote $T^2 := \co{T}{T}$ and $T^3 := \co{T}{\co{T}{T}}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Given a monad, construct a Kleisli triple from it.
Conversely, given a Kleisli triple, construct a monad from it.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}
  For each of the Kleisli triples above, describe the monad multiplication $\mu$ obtained from it.
\end{exer}

Every Kleisli triple induces a category:
\begin{dfn} Let $(T,\eta, (-)^{*})$ be a Kleisli triple over $\CC$. The \textbf{Kleisli category}, denoted by $\CC_{T}$, is the category defined by the following data:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Ob{(\CC_T)} := \Ob{\CC}$.
\item For each $X,Y\in\Ob{(\CC_T)}$, $\CHom{\CC_T}{X}{Y} := \CHom{\CC}{X}{TY}$.
\item The identity on $X\in\Ob{(\CC_T)}$ is $\eta_X$.
\item The composition of $f\in \CHom{\CC_T}{X}{Y}$ and $f\in \CHom{\CC_T}{Y}{Z}$ is $\co{f}{g^{*}}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{exer} Show that for every Kleisli triple, its Kleisli category satisfies the properties of a category.
\end{exer}

  Another use of monads is the mathematical modelling of \emph{substitution}.
  See, for instance, Altenkirch and Reus' paper \cite{DBLP:conf/csl/AltenkirchR99}.
